<h1>MyndPot Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Welcome to MyndPot! This Privacy Policy explains how MyndPot (“we”, “us”, or “our”), operated under the private
developer name Landown, collects, uses, and protects information about you when you use our tasks app available on the
Google Play Store and Apple App Store. By using MyndPot, you agree to the collection and use of information in
accordance with this policy.

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
We collect the following information to provide and improve our app’s functionality:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Email Address:</strong> we will use this to inform you about changes in our <i>Terms of Service</i> and <i>Privacy
    Policy</i>.
    We don't share your email with any third parties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Google ID or Apple ID:</strong> we use this to provide you with a unique identifier to access our services.
    We may log this ID in some of our server logs in Google Cloud Platform (for our own debugging usage), but we don't
    share this information with any third parties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Token:</strong> we use this to send you reminders and notifications.
    We share it with Firebase Cloud Messaging when we need to send you a notification. We don't share it with any other
    third parties.
  </li>
</ul>

All your tasks are stored locally in your device. We also offer optional features that allow you to:
<ul>
  <li> Create a backup of your tasks, which is encrypted on your device before being stored on our server located in
    Belgium.
  </li>
  <li> Store images for your tasks, which are encrypted and stored on Google Cloud Storage servers located in the United
    States. These images can only be accessed by you through a secure, signed URL when you are logged in.
  </li>
  <li> Create reminders, where the title of the task is temporarily stored on our server until the reminder is sent.
    This data is deleted immediately after the reminder has been sent.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Calendar Integration</h2>
We offer an optional calendar integration feature to allow you to sync tasks from MyndPot with your device’s calendar.
Specifically:
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Google Calendar (Android & iOS):</strong> We create a dedicated calendar within your Google Calendar service for your MyndPot
    tasks. We do not access or modify any other calendars or events in your Google account.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Apple Calendar (iOS)</strong>: We add tasks to your Apple Calendar for those who opt in on iOS devices. Again, we do not
    access or modify any events on your device that are not related to MyndPot.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Usage and Permissions</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Scope of Access: We only write events (corresponding to your tasks) to the calendar we create or (add them to
    your existing iOS Apple Calendar). We do not read or collect any details of your existing calendar events.
  </li>
  <li> Purpose: The calendar integration is solely used to sync and manage MyndPot task deadlines within the user’s
    chosen calendar.
  </li>
  <li> User Control: You can enable or disable calendar syncing at any time in the app’s settings. Revoking permission
    to access your calendar will prevent MyndPot from creating or updating calendar events but does not affect your
    tasks stored within the MyndPot app itself.
  </li>
  <li> Storage of Calendar Data: We do not store any calendar event details on our servers, apart from the calendar
    event id that is stored in your encrypted backup, should you use this feature. Any event entries created by MyndPot
    in your Google or Apple Calendar remain on your device or within your personal calendar account.
  </li>
</ul>
By using the optional calendar integration feature, you agree to grant MyndPot the necessary permissions to write to
your device’s calendar service. You can revoke these permissions at any time via your device settings. At the time of
writing this, this is done via:
<ul>
  <li>
    Google Calendar: go to Google Security settings > Under "Third-party apps with account access", find MyndPot >
    Click "Remove Access".
  </li>
  <li> Apple Calendar: Settings > Privacy & Security > Calendars > Find MyndPot > Toggle off calendar access.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
Your task data and backups are securely stored on servers located in Belgium. Images associated with your tasks are
stored on Google Cloud Storage servers in the United States. All data is only used to provide you with the service's
functionality. Your data, including task backups and images, remains encrypted during transit and at rest on our
servers. Task titles used for reminders are stored only until the reminder is executed and are then permanently deleted
from our servers. Images can only be accessed by you through secure, signed URLs when you are logged in to the app.

  <h2>Analytics (Firebase Analytics)</h2>
  We use Firebase Analytics within our Flutter app to collect anonymized usage information that helps us understand how
  the app is used and to improve performance and user experience. This includes events such as app opens, screen views,
  button taps, feature usage, and technical metadata like device model, operating system version, approximate location
  (e.g., country/region), app version, and session duration.
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No advertising use:</strong> Advertising features and ad personalization are disabled. Analytics data is
      used solely to analyze usage of our own app and is not shared with advertising networks.</li>
    <li><strong>No task content tracking:</strong> We do not send the content of your tasks (such as titles, descriptions,
      or images) to Firebase Analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Anonymization:</strong> Data is aggregated and anonymized to the extent supported by Firebase Analytics.
      We do not use analytics data to identify individual users.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Analytics events may be retained by Firebase for up to 14 months, subject to Firebase
      project settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Learn more:</strong> See Google’s Privacy Policy at
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">policies.google.com/privacy</a>

  </ul>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
We retain your personal data as long as your account remains active, or you request your data removal.
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Data Deletion Request:</strong> If you request the deletion of your personal data (without deleting your
    account), your images and associated data will be permanently removed from our servers (including Google Cloud
    Storage) within 7 days.
  </li>
