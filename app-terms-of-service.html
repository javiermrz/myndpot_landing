<body>
<h1>MyndPot Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
By accessing or using MyndPot, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our <a href="./app_privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our services.

<h2>2. Registration and account</h2>
To use MyndPot, you must sign in using your Google account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
your account information and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to use our services for lawful
purposes only and you are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws.
<br>
<strong>Age Restriction:</strong> You must be 13 years of age or older to use MyndPot. By using MyndPot, you confirm
that you meet the minimum age requirement.

<h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
MyndPot allows you to create tasks locally and back up your encrypted data to our servers, and store
encrypted images associated with your tasks. You retain all rights to the content you create, but by uploading backups
or images, you grant us permission to encrypt and store this data securely on our servers (and Google Cloud Storage
for images). When you use the reminder feature, the title of the task is temporarily stored on our servers until the
reminder is sent and then deleted immediately afterwards. By using these features, you allow us to store and process
your data as described.

<h2>4. Calendar Integration</h2>
MyndPot provides an optional calendar integration feature that lets you sync tasks with your device’s calendar
(Google Calendar on Android, and Google Calendar or Apple Calendar on iOS).

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Creation of a Dedicated Calendar (Android):</strong> MyndPot will create a dedicated calendar within your
    Google Calendar for app-related events. We do not read or modify any existing calendars or events outside of this dedicated calendar.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adding Events to Apple Calendar (iOS):</strong> On iOS devices, MyndPot will add events to your Apple Calendar,
    but does not read or modify any other calendar entries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited Data Access:</strong> We only write events related to your MyndPot tasks. We do not track or
    collect information about your other calendar events.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User Control:</strong> You may enable or disable calendar syncing at any time through your device settings. At the time of writing this, this is done via:
    <ul>
      <li>Android: Settings > Apps > MyndPot > Permissions > Toggle off the calendar permission.</li>
      <li>iOS: Settings > MyndPot > Calendar > Toggle off the calendar access.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    By granting the necessary permissions on your device, you acknowledge that MyndPot can write new task events to your chosen calendar service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> MyndPot is not liable for any issues arising from conflicts with other calendar events,
    third-party calendar settings, or user modifications made outside the app.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Image Storage and Access</h2>
Images associated with your tasks are stored in an encrypted format on our servers. These images can only be accessed
by you through secure, signed URLs when you are logged into the app. You are responsible for the content of the images
you upload and must ensure they comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

<h2>6. Prohibited Actions</h2>
You are prohibited from:

<ul>
  <li>Using MyndPot to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activities.</li>
  <li>Attempting to bypass or crack the subscription system or any security features of the app.</li>
  <li>Exploiting the app in any way that could impair anyone else’s use of it.</li>
  <li>Uploading, storing, or sharing any content that infringes on intellectual property rights, violates privacy laws, or contains illegal or harmful material.</li>
  <li>Misusing the image storage feature for purposes unrelated to personal task management, such as hosting web images, creating image galleries, streaming content, or any other use that could be considered a substitute for dedicated image hosting or content delivery services.</li>
  <li>Using MyndPot's storage or bandwidth in a way that places excessive burden on our systems or that is inconsistent with normal app usage for personal task management.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
While we strive to ensure MyndPot is always available, there may be instances when the service may be interrupted, including, but not limited to, routine maintenance or upgrades. In the event of a downtime, we will attempt to restore services as swiftly as possible.
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We are not responsible for any data loss or corruption, including backup data mismatches, images accidental deletion or incompatibilities with current app versions, or calendar event issues.
